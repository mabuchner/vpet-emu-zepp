# Agent Guidelines — vpet-emu-zepp

## Vision

vpet-emu-zepp aims to faithfully emulate first-generation virtual pet devices (E0C6200 CPU architecture) on modern Zepp OS 4 smartwatches. The goal is to let people experience classic virtual pets — such as the Tamagotchi P1 and Digimon — on wearable hardware, with accuracy, performance, and a minimal footprint as guiding principles.

## Commit Message Guidelines

- Write commit messages that are clear and self-contained.
- **Do not include URLs in commit messages** unless the URL serves as a direct reference (e.g., linking to an upstream specification, a relevant issue in another project, or a source that directly informed the change). Informational or promotional URLs are not appropriate.
